# Hi there 

#About

Recently completed my Level 4 Full Stack Developer course at @ Mission Ready, in my spare time I try to code as often as I can to polish up on my Javascript skills. When I need a break from coding or assignments I turn to trying out some new baking recipes.

End goal after completing my internship in Wellington, will be to move to Thailand and be a bit of a digital nomad :)

:computer: Currently studying Level 5 Software Development at Mission Ready here in Wellington, New Zealand
